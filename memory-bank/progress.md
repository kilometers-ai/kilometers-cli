## Architecture Transformation - COMPLETE SUCCESS ✅

### **Before: Session-Based Architecture**
```
CLI Command → MonitoringSession (State) → Stream Proxy → Message Storage → Events
                     ↓ 
        Complex State Management + Lifecycle Coordination
```

### **After: Event-Driven Architecture**  
```
CLI Command + CorrelationID → Stream Proxy → Events (Real-time)
                                   ↓
                      Pure Event Stream Processing
```

### **Key Changes Made**
1. **Domain Layer**: Eliminated `MonitoringSession`, updated message correlation
2. **Application Layer**: Services accept parameters directly instead of session objects
