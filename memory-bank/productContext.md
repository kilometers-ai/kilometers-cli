# Product Context: Why Kilometers CLI Exists

## The Problem Space

### The Rise of AI Assistants and MCP
AI assistants are becoming integral to development workflows, with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerging as the standard for AI-to-tool communication. However, this creates new challenges:

- **Visibility Gap**: Organizations lack visibility into what their AI assistants are actually doing
- **Security Concerns**: AI assistants can access sensitive systems and data without proper oversight
- **Debugging Complexity**: When AI assistants misbehave, there's no easy way to understand what happened
- **Compliance Requirements**: Organizations need audit trails for AI assistant interactions

### Current Pain Points

#### 1. Black Box AI Interactions
```
Developer: "The AI assistant isn't working properly with our Linear integration"
Problem: No way to see what MCP messages are being exchanged
Solution: km monitor provides real-time message visibility
```

#### 2. Security Blind Spots
```
Security Team: "What data is our AI assistant accessing?"
Problem: No audit trail of AI assistant actions
Solution: km provides comprehensive event logging with risk analysis
```

#### 3. Performance Issues
```
Operations: "The AI assistant is slow when searching large datasets"
Problem: No visibility into message sizes or processing patterns
Solution: km provides performance metrics and filtering capabilities
```

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: AI Developer Debugging
**User**: Sarah, Senior AI Developer  
**Goal**: Debug why her custom MCP server isn't working with Claude Desktop  
**Journey**:
1. Wraps her MCP server with `km monitor python my_server.py`
2. Sees real-time MCP messages and identifies malformed JSON responses
3. Fixes the server and validates with km monitoring
4. **Value**: Reduced debugging time from hours to minutes

### Scenario 2: Security Audit
**User**: Mike, Security Engineer  
**Goal**: Audit AI assistant access to sensitive Linear data  
**Journey**:
1. Configures km to monitor Linear MCP server with risk detection enabled
2. Reviews high-risk events flagged by km (data access, modifications)
3. Creates security policies based on km insights
4. **Value**: Proactive security monitoring instead of reactive incident response

### Scenario 3: Performance Optimization
**User**: Alex, DevOps Engineer  
**Goal**: Optimize AI assistant performance in CI/CD pipeline  
**Journey**:
1. Uses km to monitor MCP server in CI environment
2. Identifies large payload transfers slowing down builds
3. Implements filtering to reduce unnecessary data transfer
4. **Value**: 40% reduction in CI build times

## Market Context

### Competitive Landscape
- **Generic Process Monitors**: Tools like `strace` show system calls but don't understand MCP
- **API Monitoring Tools**: Focus on HTTP APIs, not MCP JSON-RPC protocol
- **AI Development Tools**: Provide coding assistance but lack runtime monitoring
- **Security Tools**: Monitor network traffic but miss application-level AI interactions

### Unique Value Proposition
Kilometers CLI is the **first purpose-built tool for MCP monitoring**, combining:
- Native understanding of MCP protocol and semantics
- AI-specific risk detection patterns
- Developer-friendly CLI interface
- Enterprise security and compliance features
