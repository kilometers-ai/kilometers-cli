# Product Context: Why Kilometers CLI Exists

## The Problem Space

### The Rise of AI Assistants and MCP
AI assistants are becoming integral to development workflows, with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerging as the standard for AI-to-tool communication. However, this creates new challenges:

- **Visibility Gap**: Organizations lack visibility into what their AI assistants are actually doing
- **Debugging Complexity**: When AI assistants misbehave, there's no easy way to understand what happened
- **Performance Issues**: AI workflows can be slow or inefficient without proper monitoring
- **Integration Challenges**: Developers need to understand how AI assistants interact with their tools

### Current Pain Points

#### 1. Black Box AI Interactions
```
Developer: "The AI assistant isn't working properly with our Linear integration"
Problem: No way to see what MCP messages are being exchanged
Solution: km monitor provides real-time message visibility
```

#### 2. Debugging Difficulties
```
DevOps Team: "Our AI workflow is failing intermittently"
Problem: No logs or traces of AI assistant behavior
Solution: km provides comprehensive event logging and session tracking
```

#### 3. Performance Issues
```
Product Team: "AI assistant responses are too slow"
Problem: No insight into where time is being spent
Solution: km reveals bottlenecks in AI-to-tool communication
```

#### 4. Integration Complexity
```
Engineer: "How does the AI assistant use our GitHub integration?"
Problem: No visibility into actual MCP method calls and responses
Solution: km shows exact API usage patterns and data flow
```

## Use Cases and Scenarios

### Development Workflow Integration

#### Scenario 1: AI Agent Development
```bash
# Developer building an AI agent with GitHub integration
km monitor --server -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github

# See real-time messages as AI agent interacts with GitHub
# Understand which API calls are being made
# Debug authentication and permission issues
# Optimize request patterns
```

#### Scenario 2: Linear Integration Debugging
```bash
# Product team troubleshooting AI assistant Linear integration
km monitor --batch-size 5 --server -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-linear

# Watch Linear API calls in real-time
# Identify slow or failing requests
# Understand data flow and transformations
# Validate expected behavior
```

#### Scenario 3: Custom MCP Server Testing
```bash
# Engineer testing custom MCP server implementation
km monitor --debug-replay test_scenarios.jsonl --server -- python -m my_mcp_server

# Replay known scenarios for testing
# Validate protocol compliance
# Test error handling and edge cases
# Document expected behavior patterns
```

### Production Monitoring

#### Scenario 4: AI Agent JSON Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "km",
      "args": ["monitor", "--server", "--", "npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    },
    "linear": {
      "command": "km",
      "args": ["monitor", "--server", "--", "npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-linear"]
    }
  }
}
```
**Outcome**: Automatic monitoring of all AI assistant interactions in production

#### Scenario 5: Performance Optimization
- **Monitor message frequency and patterns**
- **Identify bottlenecks in AI workflows**
- **Optimize batch sizes and request patterns**
- **Track performance improvements over time**

## Market Positioning
