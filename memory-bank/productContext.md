# Product Context - Kilometers CLI

## Why This Exists

### The Problem
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a new standard for connecting AI assistants with external tools and data sources. However, debugging MCP integrations is challenging because:

1. **Opaque Communication**: JSON-RPC messages between clients and servers are invisible during normal operation
2. **Complex Debugging**: No standard tooling exists for monitoring MCP message flows
3. **Large Payloads**: MCP servers often return substantial data that's difficult to inspect
4. **Development Friction**: Developers struggle to understand why MCP integrations fail or behave unexpectedly

### Real-World Impact
- **AI Development Teams**: Spend hours debugging MCP integration issues without visibility into the communication layer
- **MCP Server Authors**: Cannot easily test their implementations against various clients
- **Platform Integrators**: Struggle to validate MCP server behavior in production-like environments

## How It Solves These Problems

### 1. Transparent Monitoring
The km CLI acts as a "wire tap" for MCP communication, providing complete visibility into JSON-RPC message flows without disrupting the actual communication.

### 2. Universal Compatibility
Works with any MCP server implementation:
- Node.js servers (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-github`)
- Python servers (`python -m my_mcp_server`)
- Dockerized servers (`docker run my-mcp-server`)
- Custom executables

### 3. Developer-Friendly Output
Provides structured, readable logs of all MCP communication with:
- Timestamps and message IDs
- Request/response pairing
- Method extraction and categorization
- Error detection and highlighting

### 4. Real-Time Event Streaming
Captures complete monitoring events that can be:
- Viewed in real-time during development
- Sent to external APIs for analysis
- Correlated across multiple monitoring runs
- Used for automated testing and validation

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Users
1. **MCP Server Developers**: Building and testing new MCP server implementations
2. **AI Application Developers**: Integrating MCP servers into AI applications
3. **DevOps Engineers**: Monitoring MCP servers in production environments

### Usage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: MCP Server Development
```bash
# Developer testing their new MCP server
km monitor --server -- python -m my_new_server
# Sees all JSON-RPC communication in real-time
# Validates compliance with MCP specification
```

#### Scenario 2: Integration Debugging
```bash
# AI app developer debugging Claude integration
km monitor --server -- npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-linear
# Identifies why certain queries fail
# Understands expected message formats
```

#### Scenario 3: Production Monitoring
```bash
# DevOps monitoring production MCP server
km monitor --buffer-size 100MB --server -- docker run prod-mcp-server
# Captures performance metrics
# Identifies error patterns
```

### Success Experience
1. **5-Minute Setup**: From download to first monitoring event stream
2. **Zero Learning Curve**: Familiar Unix command patterns
3. **Immediate Value**: See MCP communication instantly
4. **No Disruption**: Original workflow continues unchanged
5. **Rich Insights**: Understand MCP behavior patterns
