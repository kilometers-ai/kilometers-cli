# Project Brief: Kilometers CLI

## Project Overview
Kilometers CLI (`km`) is a monitoring and analysis tool for Model Context Protocol (MCP) server processes. It provides real-time monitoring, risk analysis, and insights into AI assistant interactions by intercepting and analyzing MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 messages.

## Core Mission
Enable developers and organizations to monitor, analyze, and gain insights from AI assistant interactions through comprehensive MCP event monitoring with intelligent risk detection and filtering capabilities.

## Primary Goals

### 1. MCP Event Monitoring
- **Real-time Process Monitoring**: Wrap and monitor MCP server processes
- **Message Interception**: Capture all JSON-RPC 2.0 messages (requests/responses)
- **Session Management**: Group events into logical monitoring sessions
- **Stream Processing**: Handle high-volume message streams efficiently

### 2. Risk Analysis & Security
- **Automated Risk Detection**: Analyze events for potential security risks
- **Pattern-based Analysis**: Identify high-risk methods and payloads
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Customize risk detection criteria
- **Real-time Alerting**: Flag high-risk events as they occur

### 3. Intelligent Filtering
- **Method-based Filtering**: Include/exclude specific MCP methods
- **Size-based Filtering**: Handle large payloads appropriately  
- **Risk-based Filtering**: Focus on events above risk thresholds
- **Content Filtering**: Filter based on payload content patterns

### 4. Platform Integration
- **Cloud Connectivity**: Send events to Kilometers platform for analysis
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently batch events for transmission
- **API Integration**: Seamless integration with Kilometers API
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration for teams

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Monitor any MCP server process via command line wrapping
- Parse and validate JSON-RPC 2.0 message formats
- Apply configurable filtering rules to reduce noise
- Analyze events for security and operational risks
- Batch and send events to remote platform
- Provide real-time status and statistics
- Support multiple concurrent monitoring sessions

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Handle high-volume message streams (1000+ events/sec)
- **Reliability**: Graceful handling of process failures and network issues
- **Usability**: Simple CLI interface requiring minimal configuration
- **Extensibility**: Pluggable risk detection and filtering strategies
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully monitor real-world MCP servers (Linear, GitHub, etc.)
2. Accurately parse and analyze large JSON payloads (1MB+)
3. Provide meaningful risk insights for security teams
4. Reduce monitoring noise through intelligent filtering
5. Seamless integration with existing AI development workflows

## Target Users
- **AI Developers**: Monitor their MCP server implementations
- **Security Teams**: Analyze AI assistant interactions for risks
- **DevOps Engineers**: Integrate monitoring into CI/CD pipelines
- **Organizations**: Gain visibility into AI assistant usage patterns

## Project Constraints
- Must work with any MCP server implementation
- Single binary deployment with minimal dependencies
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Backward compatibility with existing MCP protocol versions
- Enterprise-grade security and configuration management
