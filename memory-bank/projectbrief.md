# Project Brief: Kilometers CLI

## Project Overview
Kilometers CLI (`km`) is a monitoring and analysis tool for Model Context Protocol (MCP) server processes. It provides real-time monitoring and insights into AI assistant interactions by intercepting and analyzing MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 messages.

## Core Mission
Enable developers and organizations to monitor, analyze, and gain insights from AI assistant interactions through comprehensive MCP event monitoring with intelligent session management and platform integration.

## Primary Goals

### 1. MCP Event Monitoring
- **Real-time Process Monitoring**: Wrap and monitor MCP server processes seamlessly
- **Message Interception**: Capture all JSON-RPC 2.0 messages (requests, responses, notifications)
- **Session Management**: Group events into logical monitoring sessions with smart batching
- **Stream Processing**: Handle high-volume message streams efficiently with minimal overhead

### 2. Developer Experience
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-box with any MCP server
- **Clean CLI Interface**: Intuitive `--server --` syntax for command separation
- **AI Agent Integration**: Drop-in replacement for MCP servers in JSON configurations
- **Debug Capabilities**: Event recording and replay for testing and troubleshooting

### 3. Platform Integration
- **Cloud Connectivity**: Send events to Kilometers platform for analysis and visualization
- **Session Tracking**: Comprehensive interaction flow monitoring
- **Analytics Ready**: Rich data for performance optimization and usage insights
- **Enterprise Support**: Team collaboration and organizational visibility

### 4. Production Readiness
- **High Performance**: <10ms monitoring overhead with bounded resource usage
- **Cross-Platform**: Native binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Reliable Operation**: 99.9% uptime with graceful error handling
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handle 1000+ messages/second sustainably

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Full JSON-RPC 2.0 specification support
- **Process Wrapping**: Transparent monitoring without server modification
- **Event Batching**: Configurable batch sizes for optimal performance
- **Configuration Management**: Multi-source config with intelligent defaults

### Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration test suite
- **Code Quality**: Clean architecture following DDD and Hexagonal patterns
- **Documentation**: Complete user guides, API docs, and examples
- **Release Automation**: Automated CI/CD with cross-platform builds

### Performance Targets
- **Latency**: <10ms monitoring overhead per message
- **Memory**: <50MB memory footprint for typical usage
- **Throughput**: 1000+ messages/second processing capability
- **Startup**: <1 second from command to monitoring start

## Success Criteria

### User Adoption
- **Time to Value**: <5 minutes from installation to first insights
- **Integration Ease**: Single command change for AI agent integration
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on usability and reliability
- **Community Growth**: Active usage across AI development teams

### Technical Excellence
- **Reliability**: 99.9% successful monitoring sessions
- **Performance**: Meet all latency and throughput targets
- **Compatibility**: Work with all major MCP server implementations
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented, testable codebase

### Business Impact
- **Platform Engagement**: Active usage of Kilometers platform analytics
- **Market Position**: Recognized as the standard MCP monitoring tool
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Adoption by major AI assistant platforms
- **Enterprise Readiness**: Organizational deployments and support capabilities
