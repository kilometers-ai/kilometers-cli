# Kilometers CLI - Project Brief

## Project Overview
**Name**: Kilometers CLI (`km`)  
**Purpose**: MCP Server Monitoring Proxy  
**Repository**: kilometers-ai/kilometers-cli

## Core Mission
Create a command-line tool that acts as a transparent proxy for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, capturing and logging JSON-RPC communication for debugging, analysis, and development purposes.

## Primary Use Case
```bash
km monitor --server -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
```

The tool intercepts all JSON-RPC messages between MCP clients and servers without disrupting the communication flow.

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Universal MCP Server Support**: Work with any MCP server command (npx, docker, python, custom executables)
2. **Transparent Proxying**: Act as invisible middleware between client and server
3. **JSON-RPC Logging**: Capture and log all request/response messages with metadata
4. **Unix Command Syntax**: Support standard `--server --` command separation pattern
5. **Real-Time Event Processing**: Process and forward monitoring events immediately
6. **Large Message Handling**: Handle 1MB+ JSON payloads without buffer errors

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Minimal latency overhead (<10ms per message)
2. **Reliability**: Graceful degradation when monitoring fails
3. **Cross-Platform**: Support Linux, macOS, and Windows
4. **Zero Dependencies**: Single binary with no external runtime requirements

## Technical Constraints
- **Language**: Go (for performance and cross-platform support)
- **Architecture**: Domain-Driven Design with Clean Architecture patterns
- **CLI Framework**: Cobra for robust command-line interface
- **Message Format**: JSON-RPC 2.0 specification compliance
- **Process Management**: Native OS process execution and stream handling

## Success Metrics
1. ✅ Successfully proxy communication for major MCP servers (GitHub, Linear, etc.)
2. ✅ Handle large payloads (1MB+) without errors
3. ✅ Capture 100% of JSON-RPC messages in real-time
4. ✅ Zero message loss or corruption during proxying
5. ✅ Installation and usage by developers within 5 minutes
6. ✅ **BONUS: Extensible Plugin System** - Real go-plugin framework integration

## Out of Scope (Phase 1)
- Real-time message analysis or filtering
- Web-based monitoring dashboard
- Message replay modification or injection
- Integration with external monitoring systems
- Custom MCP server implementations

## Project Context
This tool supports the Kilometers.ai ecosystem by providing essential debugging and monitoring capabilities for MCP server development and integration. It enables developers to understand MCP communication patterns and troubleshoot integration issues effectively.
