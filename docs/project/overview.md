# Kilometers CLI: Comprehensive Project Knowledge

## Executive Summary

Kilometers CLI (`km`) is a pioneering monitoring and analysis tool for Model Context Protocol (MCP) communications, positioning itself as the first purpose-built observability solution for AI assistant interactions. The project represents a critical infrastructure component in the emerging AI operations ecosystem, providing organizations with unprecedented visibility into AI assistant behavior and performance characteristics.

## Product Vision & Strategic Positioning

### Core Value Proposition
Kilometers CLI transforms AI assistant interactions from opaque black-box operations into transparent, auditable, and optimizable processes. By intercepting and analyzing MCP communications in real-time, it enables:

- **Operational Visibility**: Real-time monitoring of AI assistant actions and data access
- **Performance Optimization**: Insights into bottlenecks and inefficiencies in AI workflows  
- **Debugging Capabilities**: Rapid identification and resolution of AI integration issues
- **Session Intelligence**: Comprehensive tracking of AI interaction patterns and lifecycle

### Market Position
The product occupies a unique position as the first specialized tool for MCP monitoring, addressing a critical gap in the AI infrastructure stack. As organizations increasingly rely on AI assistants for business-critical operations, the need for specialized monitoring tools becomes paramount.

## Architecture & Technical Foundation

### Domain-Driven Design Implementation
The architecture follows strict Domain-Driven Design principles with clear bounded contexts:

```
Core Domain Layer (Pure Business Logic)
├── Event Domain: MCP message representation and lifecycle
├── Session Aggregate: Monitoring session management and batching
└── Core Business Rules: Message processing and validation

Application Layer (Use Cases & Orchestration)
├── Command Handlers: CQRS command processing
├── Application Services: Business process orchestration  
└── Port Interfaces: Dependency abstractions

Infrastructure Layer (Technical Adapters)
├── Process Monitor: MCP server process wrapping
├── API Gateway: Platform communication
├── Configuration: Multi-source configuration management
└── Message Processing: JSON-RPC protocol handling
```

### Hexagonal Architecture Benefits

## User Experience & Integration

### CLI-First Design
The tool prioritizes command-line simplicity with the clean `--server --` syntax:
```bash
# Simple, unambiguous command structure
km monitor --server -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
```

### AI Agent Integration
Drop-in compatibility with existing MCP configurations:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "km",
      "args": ["monitor", "--server", "--", "npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Philosophy
- **Minimal by Design**: Smart defaults reduce configuration overhead
- **Environment Aware**: Automatically detects development vs production contexts
- **Override Friendly**: Command-line flags override file-based configuration

## Quality & Testing Strategy

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Focus on domain logic with property-based testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end monitoring scenarios
- **Contract Tests**: MCP protocol compliance verification
- **Performance Tests**: Latency and throughput validation

### Code Quality Standards
- **Go Best Practices**: Idiomatic Go with comprehensive linting
- **Domain Purity**: Zero external dependencies in domain layer
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces for testability
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean component composition and testing
